# API Design and Development for Davivienda

This repository contains the design and development of secure APIs for the Davivienda project. The project integrates legacy banking systems with modern cloud platforms using MuleSoft's Anypoint Platform.

## Technologies Used:
- **MuleSoft Anypoint Platform**: For API development and deployment.
- **REST & SOAP**: For developing secure APIs.
- **Java**: For API implementation.
- **Agile**: Methodology for iterative development.

## API Design:
- **REST API**: Secure endpoints were created to handle client and banking data, ensuring fast and reliable transactions.
- **SOAP API**: Legacy systems integration using SOAP to handle critical financial data securely.

## Setup:
1. **Install MuleSoft Anypoint Studio**:
   Follow the guide in `tools/mulesoft-tools/mulesoft-studio-setup.md`.

2. **API Deployment**:
   Learn how to deploy APIs using MuleSoft's API Manager in the file `tools/mulesoft-tools/api-manager-deployment.md`.

3. **Test the APIs**:
   See the test cases for both REST and SOAP in the `src/api-test-cases.md`.

## Getting Started:
Clone this repository and follow the setup instructions to get started with the API development environment.
